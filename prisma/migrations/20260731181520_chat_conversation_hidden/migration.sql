-- NOTE: `prisma migrate dev` also emitted `DROP INDEX "catalog_synonyms_term_trgm"` here. That is
-- pre-existing drift, not part of this change: the index is a raw-SQL GIN trigram index created by
-- 20260727090000_add_feed_foundation and never modelled in schema.prisma, so every diff wants to
-- drop it. Removed deliberately — dropping it would silently deoptimise catalog search.

-- AlterTable
ALTER TABLE "conversation_members" ADD COLUMN     "hidden" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
